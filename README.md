To be updated with a description for a collaborative semester long project

## Tentative Group Members

These members were selected because of your broad interests in the past (think history), as well as what might be thought of as more academic topics, like literature or even studying academia itself. You are not required to keep your group focused on this area for this project, but I share this broad overview to hopefully help spark initial brainstorming together.

_Please note this list of members is tentative and subject to change as students join or leave the class in the next week or so._

- Lhaye D.
