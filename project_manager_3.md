# Project Manager Weekly Report (Avery Webster)

## Weekly Checklist

- [x] Created a weekly report for the group project
- [x] Updated the project board
- [x] Checked in with team members
- [x] Assigned tasks for the upcoming week
- [x] Close issue once the weekly tasks are completed

## Weekly Summary:

- What were the goals for this week for the group project?
    
    - We discussed different possibilties for how to complete the Proprietary & Perspectival Dataset Creation assignment. We wanted to complete the assignment obviously, but also figure out ways in which this assignment could help us with our final project. Our dataset from this assignment doesn't relate to our final project, but we believe the concepts we used in this assignment can help us.

- What has been accomplished?
   
   - We fully planned out and then finished the Proprietary & Perspectival Dataset Creation assignment. Everyone was given their roles, and we completed each step of the assignment. In addition, we also have dicussed ideas for our final project on book banning, including scraping the GoodReads website to get information on some popular banned books. The information we are looking for are things like genre(s) and some metadata.

- Any problems or issues that need resolving?
    We still need to figure out how we are going to obtain metadata for our final project. We haven't fully decided on how we are going to obtain proper metadata. We also need to agree on how we are going to represent the data, as there are many paths we can go down with book banning.

- Who is assigned to what tasks on Proprietary & Perspective Data Creation?
    
    Lhaye D. - Work on part 1 & 2
    
    Aditi D. - Work on part 2 & 3

    Everyone - Provided data to the dataset
    

## Next Week's Goals:

- What are the goals for the upcoming week?
    
    - We want to finalize our plan for the final project, so that everyone knows our goals, and everyone knows their roles. We plan to obtain our final dataset as well, so we can start cleaning and analyzing it.
