**Platform:** Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en)
Our platform is Instagram. We chose this platform because many of us have Instagram accounts and posts, and therefore we can use those posts to form our dataset. Along with those, Instagram is an extremely popular platform for our age group, so it is always useful to learn more about how its privacy policy works. 

**Terms of Service & Access Limitations:**
Instagram is owned by Meta and inherits its strict policy when it comes to access and usage. Despite the regulations, Meta ensures that users can view their information, download it, and even delete it:

Additionally, Meta states they keep information “for as long as they need it to provide for a feature of service.” This information can be deleted barring legal instances. Overall, Meta is committed to protecting user privacy, thus explaining their strict stance on only letting user’s access their own data.

**Bulk/Academic Methodologies:**
Certain businesses are allowed to use Meta’s data to gather information about products and how people interact with their services. This data can portray how many people interact with the product and the demographics.
Meta also allows outside researchers to conduct studies that “advance scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security, and integrity.” However, this data is limited and oftentimes requires the application to specific programs such as the Facebook Research Program. Business analytics has a fee, academic research is case by case.

**Tools and API’s**
Although Meta is noticeably strict on data privacy and use, it has not stopped researchers from finding alternative methods. They must adhere to Meta’s ethical requirements such as IRB permissions, informed consent/transparency, and minimized data efforts. Instagram allows access to the Graph API for business which provides data from public accounts and sources. In addition, there is a Basic Display API, this provides information about users and posts. However, this API is extremely limited and requires permission. 

Finally, public data is the most common avenue for researchers, this is defined as “posts shared by and information about business and creator accounts, as well as a subset of personal accounts that have been set to public and have a verified badge or 25,000 or more followers.”
	
To conclude, researchers looking to use instagram for data run into a lot of	         restrictions imposed by Meta. These barriers are in place to protect user privacy, maintain an ethical standard, and ensure that public data under certain conditions can be used. 



**Terms of Service Changes Over Time**
According to an article published by AP News this past September, Instagram is making teenagers accounts private by default. This shift to make privacy stricter for teenagers is due to backlash the company is facing, as well as lawsuits from dozens of states, about harming young people and worsening their mental health. The company is also reportedly trying to build technology that would enable them to find accounts of teens masquerading as older, and shift their accounts into the more restrictive teen accounts.
