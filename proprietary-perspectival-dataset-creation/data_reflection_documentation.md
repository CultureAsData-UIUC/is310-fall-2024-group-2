**Documenting The Data:**
The dataset is structured with 6 columns representing these 6 variables:
**Username(s):** The username(s) of the people who made this instagram post. The usernames are not anonymized, as we received permission from every user when entering this data. The data in this column is stored as a string.
**Caption:** The text under each post which generally provides a description of the post. Captions can be up to 2,200 characters long. The data in this column is stored as a string.
**Num_likes:** The number of likes that the post received. The data in this column is stored as an integer.
**Num_comments:** The number of comments that the post received. The data in this column is stored as an integer.
**Post_url:** The link to each post, allowing easy access to the images on each post. These links are meant to be accessible by all, so they are from public accounts. The data in this column is stored as a string.
**General_mood_of_post:** A subjective variable added to convey the mood or feeling that a post exhibits when viewed. There is no set list of moods you can use. You can add any mood to this column. The data in this column is stored as a string.

The data collected from this dataset is complete. Every column and row has a value to it. However, we do imagine some problems that could affect the completeness of this dataset if we were to continue adding posts. For one, the caption could be empty. There are also posts on instagram that could be strictly informational, and not cause any feeling from a viewer. The quality of our data is strong, but we do understand many of our variables would be hard to clean/sort. For example, we have no restrictions on the mood variable, so it could mean that we have thousands of different mood entries. The caption variable could also contain hundreds of words or one word, so we imagine it would be hard to find connections between them.

**Reflecting on The Data**
We chose to use the general mood of the post as the subjective part of the dataset. We did this because we thought it would be interesting to see if there could be some sort of trend between the engagement of a post and what we thought the mood of our post was. It’s also interesting to see whether we as Instagram users tend to post more of a certain kind of mood when we use the platform.

There were no difficulties in collecting this data as we used posts from our own instagram account or posts from friends. We decided to collect this data due to being able to get that information easier compared to trying to get data and consent from random users on the platform. 

In regards to the dynamics of the platform, instagram does have sponsors that promote their service or good to viewers, which might have a different form of engagement as this content moves away from the poster’s normal content. Another thing to consider is the type of social circle the poster has and what they are trying to promote. For example, a business will post about their goods or services and might get engagement from a wider audience as the goal is to get as many people to view the post. Compare this to a person who only posts for their friends and family, who might get less engagement as their circle is smaller and more personalized. 

When considering the ethical side of this, there is the valid concern of how this data is acquired. In this case because we made the dataset we were able to consent to having our posts on the dataset, but if we decided to continue with the dataset we would eventually run out of posts from our accounts and would have to use the posts from other accounts. It would be difficult getting explicit consent from them if we wanted to use their data. Although on the other hand, there is the argument that because it is posted to a public platform and it is being used for research purposes that we are able to use that data without consent from the user.
