# Feedback for Initial Project Proposal: Group 2
Overall, this is a good start for the project, and your topic is well-suited to the project's goal. The topic of banned books is very popular, so you should have no issues finding resources. I think it is a good idea to try to combine a few resources so that you have the most comprehensive data possible. The division of labor among group members seems reasonable, although it would have been good to point out the strengths of each group member and why they are well suited to the given tasks. 


I would have liked to see more information about how you will incorporate your research question into the final data analysis. What are you analyzing and what is the end goal? You begin the proposal by pointing to Google Ngram's popularity of the term “banned books.” I would encourage you to dive a little deeper into what that data is actually telling you. What you are noticing here is not the actual banning of books but an increased written conversation about the banning of books.

A few questions to consider: 
1. The research question here is a little vague. Are you planning to argue that the number of banned books tracks with “significant cultural and political turnover” or are you comparing the data of banned books in the past with the data from the 21st century? 

2. You note that you will be taking data from the ALA and UIUC archives. Will your data focus only on American book banning or international? 

3. You mentioned web scraping a few times, but it is unclear why it is needed for this project. What data will you be scraping? 

It may be helpful to think about which element of banned books you want to analyze here and narrow the scope a bit. For instance, focusing on one century or even decade, or picking a few topical issues around book banning that you want to track. Because it is such a big topic with many directions you could take it, it may get a little out of control without a clear definition of the research goal.
