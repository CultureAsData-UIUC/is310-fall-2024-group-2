# Mass Digitization & Digital Libraries Group Assignment:

The two broad cultural areas we are going to focus on are Art and Artwork and Historical Documents.

1. What might be considered a digital object or digital representation for your area of focus? You can have multiple examples, but you should explain why you consider it relating to your area of focus (this can be short though).

Books, recordings, files, documents, pictures, etc.
“consists of official records, members’ papers, correspondence, publications, photographs, audiovisual recordings, and scrapbooks.”


2. How are digital objects and representations created for your area of focus? What are the processes involved in digitizing these objects? In the African American Periodical Poetry (1900-1928) dataset, we learned about the process of digitizing periodicals and Kahle also mentioned a process called OCR, Optical Character Recognition, for extracting text from digitized print materials. What are some of the digitization processes for your area of focus?


Scanning:
- This includes taking multiple pictures
- When taking pictures, there is also the option of requesting a higher resolution of the item, which is taken with a better 
- A stable environment
- With how delicate and fragile these documents and images are, having a stable environments helps slow down the process of deterioration
- “arranged in five general areas: administrative and staff offices, associations and divisions, round tables, committees and members’ papers, and affiliated and associated organizations.”


3. Kahle repeatedly made reference to the Library of Alexandria in his article. What are some historical equivalents to digital objects in your area of focus? How do these historical objects compare to their digital counterparts?

Many different libraries across the USA, stored in the archives at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There are also some international members of the ALA. 

4. Relatedly, are there examples of born-digital materials for your area of focus? How do these materials compare to digitized objects? For those unfamiliar, born-digital materials are those that were created digitally and never existed in analog or physical form (think most social media, for example).
- social media and websites / marketing
- Some of the photography on the ALA archive website
- Meeting recordings that are more recent may have never existed in analog, although older recordings may have been on recorders or other technologies
- Emails of correspondence that have been printed, or print outs of newspaper obituaries 
- Flyers

5. What is the oldest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How has this resource been maintained and updated over time? You may also include examples that are no longer maintained or have been abandoned.

The first piece of information archived via the ALA was the S. Grant Hastings papers. (https://www.library.illinois.edu/ala/2023/10/31/50-years-of-the-ala-archives/)

6. Conversely, what is the newest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How does this resource compare to older digital libraries or archives?

https://www.library.illinois.edu/ala/blog/ these are blog posts about the ALA on their website. There only used to be things like books and research in libraries, now with the internet we can have short and less formal things like blog posts. 

7. Are there any examples of your digital object that have gone viral? How did this happen and what impact did it have on the object or the digital library/archive that hosted it?

We couldn’t find any. 

8. Can you find any examples of free vs. proprietary digital libraries or archives for your area of focus? How do these resources differ in terms of access?
- Most of the pieces of information on the archive are free, but some of them are being sold by the archive. 
- Scanning might cost some money if the items you’re requesting are not scanned yet, or if there is a time rush for researching, or if you need to scan a lot of documents
